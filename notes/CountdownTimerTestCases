This timer has the ability to go into invalid states. 
The invalid states include:
1)Creating many instances of a timer object and thus running multiple countdowns on the same countdown timer
2)no input from checkboxes
3)Getting multiple numbers for the hour, minute, second
4)Incorrect counting down logic

To fix issue 1 I do not allow the start button to be pushed more than once unless the reset button is hit first. The rest button clears everything and basically starts the timer fresh.

To fix issue 2 I added try catch blocks for nullpointer exceptions and made sure that the user first enter a valid time or else the program wont start and the display text would say "Please enter a valid time"

To fix issue 3 I made all of the time values static so that the whole class would be able to see them. I felt this was best and easiest so that even if the Timer objects were made, they would still keep the same time.
This proved to be crucial when I made the continue button as it took the same values as it did initially and kept the time consistent.

To fix issue 4 I ran this code many times with different inputs in another test class before I applied it into my code.
