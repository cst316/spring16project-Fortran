          <p>There are two new buttons that were added to Memoranda. In the menu bar under file is a new button called, import code, and the other is under the view button called, imported code. When a user clicks on the import code button, a file chooser will pop up. The user is able to choose a java file or a zip file.  After choosing a java file, the file will be read through and it will count the number of lines in that file without counting comments, which includes multi-line comments; moreover, it will not count empty lines. When importing a zip file, the program will locate java files and read through them, which was explained previously. Just after the reading the file, the name of the file and the number of lines it has, will be put into a table. The table will open and can be viewed after importing. However, it is not the only way to view what java files have been imported. The user may click on view then imported code, Memoranda will open the import table and the user may view the name of the file, along with the number of lines. The user is also able to search for a certain file in the table if they have too many files. After searching, a user is able to refresh table to its previous state.</p>
